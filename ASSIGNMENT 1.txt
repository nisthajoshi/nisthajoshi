1>WHAT IS SOFTWARE?
-> SOFTWARE IS A SET OF INSTRUCTION,DATA OR PROGRAMS USED TO OPERATE COMPUTERRS AND EXECUTE SPECIFICE TASKS.IT IS OPPOSITE OF HARDWARE,WHICH DESCRIBES THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF A COMPUTER.SOFTWARE IS A GENERIC TERM USED TO REFER TO APPLICATION,SCRIPTS, AND PROGRAMS THAT RUN ON A DEVICE.

2>TYEPS OF SOFTWARE.
-> 1)APPLICATION SOFTWARE
   2)SYSTEM SOFTWARE
   3)DRIVER SOFTWARE
   4)MIDDLEWARE\
   5)PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE 

->1)APPLICATION SOFTWARE:- 

->THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF SOFTWARE,APPLICATON SOFTWARE IS A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT PERFORMS A SPECIFION FOR A USER,OR IN SOME SASES,FOR ANOTHER APLLICATON.
->AN APPLICATIO CAN BE SELF-CONTAINED,OR IT CAN BE A GROUP OF PROGRAMS THAT RUN THE APPLICATION FOR THE USER.
->EXAMPLE OF MORDERN APPLICATION INCLUDE OFFICER SUITES,GRAPHICS SOFTWARE,DATABASE AND DATABASE MANAGMENT PROGRAMS,WEB BROWSERS,WORD PROCESSORS,SOFTWARE DEVLOPMENT TOOLS,IMAGE EDITORS AND COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS.

_>EXAMPLE:MICROSOFT OFFICE,PAINT,POWERPOINT ETC....


->2)SYSTEM SOFTWARE:-

->THESE SOFTWRE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO RUN A COMPUTER'S APPLICATON PROGRAMS AND HARDWARE.
->SYSTEM SOFTWARE COORDINATES THE ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTION OF THE HARDWARE AND SOFTEARE.
->IT CONTROLS THE OPERATION TO THE COMPUTER HARDWARE AND PROVIDES AN ENVIROMENT OR PALTFORM FOR ALL THE OTHER TYPES OF SOFTWARE TO WORK IN.
->THE OS IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF SYSTEM SOFTWARE ; IT MANAGES ALL THE OTHER COMPUTER PROGRAMS.
->OTHER EXAMPLE OF SYSTEM SOFTWARE INCLUDE THE FRIMWARE,COMPUTER LANGUAGE TRASLETORS AND SYSTEM UTLITIES...

_>EXAMPLE:NOTEPAD,CALCULATOR ETC.....

->3)DRIVER SOFTWARE:-

->ALSO KNOWN AS DEVICE DRIVERS,THIS SOFTWARE IS OFTEN CONSIDERED A TYPE OF SYSTEM SOFTWARE.
->DEVIDE DRIVERS CONTROL THE DEVICES AND PERIPHERALS CONNECTED TO COMPUTER,ENALING THEM TO PERFROM THEIR SPECIFIC TASKS.
->EVERY DEVICE THAT IS CONNECTED TO A COMPUTER NEEDS AT LEAST ONE DEVICE DRIVER TO FUNCTION.
->EXAMPLE INCLUDE SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH ANY NONSTANDARD HARDWARE,INCLUDEING SPECIAL GAME CONTROLLERS,AS WELL AS THE SOFTWARE THAT ENABLES STANDERD HARDWARE,SUCH AS USB STRONG DEVICES,KEYBOARDS,HEADPHONES AND PRINTERS.

_>EXAMPLE:AUDIO DRIVER,VIDEO DRIVER ETC....

4>MIDDLEWARE:-

->THE TERM MIDDLEWARE DESCRIBES SOFTWARE THAT MEDIATES BETWEEN APLICATION AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE OR BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE.
FOR EAXAMPLE,MIDDLEWARE ENABLES MICROSOFT WINDOWS TO TALK TO EXCEL AND WORD.
->IT IS ALSO USED TO SEND A REMOTE WORK REQUEST FROM AN APPLICATION IN A COMPUTER THAT HAS ONE KIND OF OS,TO AN APPLICATION IN A COMPUTER WITH A DIFFERENT OS.IT ALSO ENABLES NEWER ALLICATION TO WORK WITH LEGACY ONES.

5>PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE

->COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS USE PROGGRAMING SOFTWARE TO WRITE CODE.PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE AND PROGGRAMING TOOLS ENABLE DEVELOPER TO DEVLOP,WRITE,TEST,AND DEBUG OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS.
->EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE INCLUDE ASSEMBLERS,COMPILERS,DEBUGGERS AND INTERPRETERS.

3>WHAT IS SOFTWARE DEVLOOMENT METHODOLOGY?
->SOFTWARE DEVLOPMENT LIFE CYCLE(SDLC) REFRES TO A METHODOLOGY WITH CLEARLY PROCESSES FOR CREATING HIGH-QUALITY SOFTWARE IN DETAIL,THE SDLC METHODOLGY FOCUSES ON THE FOLLOWING PHASES OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT:

1.REQURIMENT GATHERING 
2.ANALYSIS
3.DESIGNING
4.IMPLEMENATATION
5.TESTING
6.MAINTENANCE

4) WHAT IS DESIGNPATTERN?
DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS WARE POPULARIZED IN THE LATE 1970,ARISISNG FROM THE BOOK STRUCTURE DESIGN,BY COMPUTING PIONEERS ED YOURDON AND LARRY CONSTANTAINE.THEY BESED IT ON THE "DATA FLOW GRAPH"
COMPUTATION MODELS BY DEVID MARTIN AND GERALD ESTRIN.THE STRUCTURE DESIGN CONCEPT TOOK OFF IN THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FILELD,AND THE DFD METHOD TOOK OFF WITH IT.IT BECAME MORE POPULAR IN BUSSINESS CIRCLES,AS IT WAS APPLIED TO BUSIYSIS,THEN IN ACEDEMIC CICLES.

-->INTERMEDIATE

1) WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APLICATION SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE? 
--> SYSTEM SOFTWARE: IS THE TYPE OF SOFTWARE THAT IS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN APPLICATION SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM.LOW-LEVEL LANGUAGE ARE USED TO WEITE THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.SYSTEM SOFTWARE MAINTAINS THE SYSTEM RESOURCES AND GIVEN THE PATH FOR APPLICATION SOFTWARE TO RUN.AN IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WITHOUT SYSTEM SOFTWARE,THE SYSTEM CAN NOT RUN.IT IS GENERAL-PRURPOSE SOFTWARE.
-->APPLICATION SOFTWARE IS THE TYPE OF SOFTWARE THAT RUNS AS PER USER REQUEST. IT RUNS ON THE PLATFORM WHICH IS PROVIDED BY SYSTEM SOFTWARE.HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES ARE USED TO WEITE THE OTHER HAND WITHOUT APPLICATION SOFTWARE,THE LOW-LEVAL MAINTENANCE SYSTEM ALWAYS RUNS.

2) EXPLAIN THE SDLC EACH FACEPROCESS.
SDLC STAND FOR "SOFTWARE DEVLOPMENT LIFE CYCLE" MODAL IT DESCRIBEES THE SEQUNECE OF PHASES OR STEPS TO DEVLOP ANY SOFTWARE.
>IN SIMPLE WORD "ENTITY LIFE TIME OF SLW FROM BEGINIG TO ENDING"
